# Haskell Turing Machine

Pretty self-explanatory. I was given an assignment to write a Turing Machine in
the language of my choice. Since I'm already fluent in C++, and Turing Machines
are pretty simple to write, I thought I'd step out of my comfort zone and do it
in Haskell instead. This is the result.

## Usage - Linux
Make sure you have GHC installed and do:
```shell
$ make run
```
